### Phase 2:
*device_server.py*: the application I made for the device module. It defines the patient database and the api to perform operations on it.

*test.py*: the script that tests *device_server.py* by making several calls to the corresponding api.

You must first run *device_server.py* and then make calls to the api (like *test.py* does)

### Phase 1:
The work for phase 1 is included under phase1 directory; it is largely irrelevant becuase my phase2 implementation does not use it.
