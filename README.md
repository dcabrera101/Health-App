# Health-App

## Branching Strategy

All on main, the previous week's work was all but useless so no point in branching.


## Status

app.py: holds my current progress on creating APIs for managing the patients database

test.py: testing calls to the APIs in app.py

database.db: holds the patients

venv/: virtual environment where I installed all the dependencies, for version control.

nothing else is relevant, will clean up files after I reach a stopping point.
