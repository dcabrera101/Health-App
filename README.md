# Health-App

## Branching Strategy

Main holds working modules. Test holds modules getting developed/tested still.

## Note:
Recent pushes failed becuase the test scripts are being run on github, and were not designed to be. In particular the one testing the AWS EC2 instance.


## Status

- device_module/ - done

- chat module - in progress

- AWS - in progress (got it on EC2 but havent figured out how to run the server there and call it from local machine)
